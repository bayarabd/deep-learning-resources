# Some Useful Machine Learning Literature and Tools

## Deep Learning Fundamentals
### General Knowledge
* One of the most comprehensive books on **Deep Learning**, available for free: [Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Deep Learning. MIT Press, 2016.](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
* [Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition, Christopher M. Bishop](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/525960)

## Image Processing

### Image Segmentation

* [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038)
* [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) The following video tutorials (and multiple other videos from the same YouTube channel) can be also very helpful to understand U-Nets in practice.
  * [73 - Image Segmentation using U-Net - Part1 (What is U-net?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azM57JuQpQI&t=818s)
  * [74 - Image Segmentation using U-Net - Part 2 (Defining U-Net in Python using Keras)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68HR_eyzk00)

### Spatial Localization and Detection
#### Differentiable Spatial to Numerical Transform
* Papers
   * [Numerical Coordinate Regression with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07372)
* Code
   * [DSNT layer implematation with TensorFlow](https://github.com/ashwhall/dsnt)
   * [DSNT layer implematation with PyTorch](https://github.com/anibali/dsntnn)

## Tools
